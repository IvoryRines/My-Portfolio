I created a Portfolio for my full-stack coding bootcamp. The portfolio contains my name and a navigation bar in the header. When clicked, the  links in the navigation bar will take you to "about me," "work," and "contact" sections further down on the page. The "about me" section contains a recent photo of myself. When you click on the images in my "work" section, they will either redirect you to the site of the completed work or will return you to the top of the page. When you click the links in my "about me" section they will redirect you appropriately.  

This is the link to the deployed application:
